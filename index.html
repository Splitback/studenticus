    <h1>Studenticus</h1>
    <div class="theogony">
      <h2>Theogony</h2>
      <p>Studenticus is the god of students, one of the mortal-born gods, son of Anglika and Epistimus. Studenticus represents the procrastination and perseverance of students.
As a lesser known god, he is unable to be found in prevalent sources of Greek literature but has been orally passed down to this day.
Born in Athens, he honored Athena and desired to be as wise as her. He studied well in school and had a natural skill for academics, but did have a bad habit of procrastination.
In the seventh grade, he took a class called Introduction to Physical Science, taught by Dr. Kraemer, which he passed with flying colors.
Athena, the god of wisdom, saw great potential in Studenticus and immortalized him, making him the god of students.</p>

      <h2>Weapons and Items</h2>
      <h3>Magic Notebooks</h3>
      <p>Studenticus carries, or more accurately, floats around magic notebooks.
      They hover around his head and body and are easily accessible to Studenticus at all times.
      These notebooks have the ability to shoot out weapons such as paper which cuts, as well as dangerous pens and sharpened pencils.</p>
      <h3>Backpack</h3>
      <p>This magical backpack looks like a regular bag at first, but when Studenticus activates this weapon, it turns into a cardinal and silver shield. This eighty-pound behemoth of a weapon is also used as a heavy weight to be slung on enemies.</p>
      <h3>Binder of Lost Assignments</h3>
      <p>The Binder of Lost Assignments magically transports dropped assignments or books to Studenticus' binder.
      Studenticus brings the lost item to the student the following day, and the student can find it in the bottom of their backpack.</p>
