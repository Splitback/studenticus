    <h1>Studenticus</h1>
    <div id="theogony">
      <h2>Theogony</h2>
      <p>Studenticus is the god of students, one of the mortal-born gods, son of Anglika and Epistimus. Studenticus represents the procrastination and perseverance of students.
As a lesser known god, he is unable to be found in prevalent sources of Greek literature but has been orally passed down to this day.
Born in Athens, he honored Athena and desired to be as wise as her. He studied well in school and had a natural skill for academics, but did have a bad habit of procrastination.
In the seventh grade, he took a class called Introduction to Physical Science, taught by Dr. Kraemer, which he passed with flying colors.
Athena, the god of wisdom, saw great potential in Studenticus and immortalized him, making him the god of students.</p>

    <div id="weandit">
      <h2>Weapons and Items</h2>
      <h3>Magic Notebooks</h3>
      <p>Studenticus carries, or more accurately, floats around magic notebooks.
      They hover around his head and body and are easily accessible to Studenticus at all times.
      These notebooks have the ability to shoot out weapons such as paper which cuts, as well as dangerous pens and sharpened pencils.</p>
      <h3>Backpack</h3>
      <p>This magical backpack looks like a regular bag at first, but when Studenticus activates this weapon, it turns into a cardinal and silver shield. This eighty-pound behemoth of a weapon is also used as a heavy weight to be slung on enemies.</p>
      <h3>Binder of Lost Assignments</h3>
      <p>The Binder of Lost Assignments magically transports dropped assignments or books to Studenticus' binder.
      Studenticus brings the lost item to the student the following day, and the student can find it in the bottom of their backpack.</p>

      <h3>Sweatshirt</h3>
      <p>Studenticus wears a cardinal and silver sweatshirt every day as a reminder of his old school's colors.</p>

      <h2>Feast Day and Sacrifice</h2>
      <p>Studenticus' feast day is celebrated May 30th, which marks the end of the school year.</p>
      <p>As sacrifice, he requests previous homeworks to be burned in flames.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="character">
      <h2>Personality and Physical Characteristics</h2>
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>As the god of students, Studenticus is always anxious for his next task, much like a student is anxious for his or her next assignment.</p>
      <p>Along with that anxious attribute, Studenticus also comes off as stressed in the months of December and May, when — as a student — he was nearing exams.</p>
      <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
      <p>Studenticus is neither scrawny nor muscular, but somewhere in the middle. He’s an average athlete since he liked to focus on academics rather than improving his expertise in sports.</p>

    <div id="legend">
      <p>	At Montgomery Bell Academy, there were new seventh grade students being brought to meet the dangerous science deity, Ipeasus.  He had the strong physique that most science teachers had and a massive, fiery beaker that he wielded as a weapon.  When he said an element or compound, soldiers made out of that certain makeup would rise out of the ground to do his bidding.  Some were selected to teach the students about the ways of their master, but were kinder and cared for the children they taught.  The instant that the seventh graders met the mighty Ipeasus, they were a little uneasy, but ready to take the burden.
	The young scholars worked long and hard days trying to please the teachers of Ipeasus with homework and quizzes.  But soon, Ipeasus grew hungry for them to learn more and more.  The students began to struggle and the teachers reluctantly had to give more work.  The students began praying to the god Studenticus.  He heard their cries for help and began to work on a plan to defeat Ipeasus.  When he had figured out a way, he told the students to slowly start learning more subjects and doing more work than necessary, but not to tell the teachers.  If they knew about the plan, their direct link to Ipeasus would alert him and he would grow even more hungry than before.  The students complained at the obnoxious amount of work, but dutifully performed the heavy load.  It took months for the seventh graders to finally have surpassed all that they were to required to know.  When the time was right, Studenticus told the classmates to challenge Ipeasus with this proposition: if they could answer all of Ipeasus’s questions, then they were free from his rule for the length of the summer.  But if they were to fail, they had to stay at MBA and continue to learn.  Ipeasus accepted with a sly grin, not knowing of the help that they had received from the god, Studenticus.  When the examination was finished, the angry deity roared in astonishment.  He broke their agreement and told them to go directly back to the classrooms and learn even more.  As Studenticus looked down upon the scene, he grew angry at the unfair minor god and came down to face Ipeasus.  When the enraged idol realized who he was dealing with, he hefted his massive beaker over his shoulder, ready to fight.  Studenticus drew his IPS notebook from his halo of binders.  He scanned the infinite amount of notes that were scribbled across the infinite pages of writing.  From it, a massive lump of study rises and lands on Ipeasus, trapping him from tormenting the seventh graders for three months until he can escape.
	To this day, students at MBA struggle with IPS and are examined at the end of the school year.  As you know, if they fail, they must do summer school, just like the ancient bet with Ipeasus.

      <p>As the god of students, it is clear that Studenticus holds power over school campuses. Since he became a god through science, he spends a lot of his time around the laboratory.</p>
