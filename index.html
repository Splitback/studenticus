      <h2>Theogony</h2>
      <p>Studenticus is the god of students, one of the mortal-born gods, son of Anglika and Epistimus. Studenticus represents the procrastination and perseverance of students.
As a lesser known god, he is unable to be found in prevalent sources of Greek literature but has been orally passed down to this day.
Born in Athens, he honored Athena and desired to be as wise as her. He studied well in school and had a natural skill for academics, but did have a bad habit of procrastination.
In the seventh grade, he took a class called Introduction to Physical Science, taught by Dr. Kraemer, which he passed with flying colors.
Athena, the god of wisdom, saw great potential in Studenticus and immortalized him, making him the god of students.</p>
